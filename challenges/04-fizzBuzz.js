/* Totally Not Another FizzBuzz 

Scrimba CEO Per Borgen wants you to write a program to grant special bonuses to all his employees based on their employee ID numbers! 

Scrimba has 100 employees and their employee ID numbers range from 1 - 100. If the employee's ID number is: 

Divisible by 3 - Vacation! 
Divisible by 5 - $100,000 bonus! 
Divisible by both 3 and 5 - JACKPOT! 1 Million and a Yacht!
Not divisible by 3 or 5 - :(
    
Write a program to loop through all the ID numbers and print their prize. 
Your function's output should look something like this: 

1 - :(
2 - :(
3 - Vacation! 
4 - :(
5 - $100,000 bonus!

function awardBonuses(){
    for (let id = 1; id <= 100; id++) {

        if (id % 3 != 0 && id % 5 != 0) {
            console.log( id+"= " + ":(")
        } else if (id % 3 === 0 && id % 5 === 0) {
            console.log(id+"= " + "JACKPOT! 1 Million and a Yacht!")
        } else if (id % 5 === 0) {
            console.log(id+"= " + "$100,000 bonus!")
        } else if (id % 3 === 0) {
            console.log(id+"= " + "Vacation!")
        }
